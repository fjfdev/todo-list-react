## TODO list built with React.js
 This is a small application for performing Read/Delete/Update operations over a simple list of elements (Todos). 
 I have built three different approaches using three different ways that React provide us. You can check them in these branches

 * master
   <p> Here I manage state using component's state and props.</p>

 * with-redux
   <p> This version uses Redux library and manages the state by defining store, reducers and actions.</p>

 * with-hooks-useState
   * Here I have tried with [react hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), new feature of react which is currently a proposal and it is included in an alpha version of react. From all hooks available I have used __useState__.

 
 ### Dependencies
 I have used :
 -  node.js v10.12.0
 -  npx 6.4.1

 The project skeleton is built using create-react-app with npx.

 #### Execute
 ```bash 
 npm install && npm start
 ```
