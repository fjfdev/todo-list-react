## TODO list built with React.js
 This is a small application  for performing Read/Delete/Update operations over a simple list of elements (Todos). Useful for getting started with React.js with its main concepts.

 ### Dependencies
 I have used :
 -  node.js v8.11.3
 -  npx v9.7.1

 The project skeleton is built using create-react-app with npx.

 #### Execute
 ```bash 
 npm install && npm start
 ```
